# 最近commit

备份本地文档，接口调用未完成，有一些没有用的备份文件也上传了。

# Structure

主要参考这篇文章 https://www.taniarascia.com/react-architecture-directory-structure/

但感觉又没必要像她这样这么专业和细分。于是主要放了三个文件夹：
1. src/components 主要的 UI 组件放到这个文件夹下，比如说 Homepage, NavBar, Post, PostCard 诸如此类。
2. src/reducers 这个文件夹主要是存放使用 Redux 进行状态管理所需要的方法
3. src/services 这个文件夹主要是存放用来和外部 API 进行交流的方法

然后各组件和它对应的 style、test 文件放在一起。

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
